- What is mini-search-validation?
- How does validation work
- Re-train with 500 validation

- Replicate mel-spec with esssentia
  - Why is the 3dB difference?
  - Train the replication and best model again
  - Warning: essentia can currently only accept numpy arrays of dtype "single". "signal" dtype is double. Precision will be automatically truncated into "single".??*

- Try 50% overlap maybe 75% is too much
- Try log-mel spectrogram (log frequency axis)
